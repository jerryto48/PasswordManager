#Password Manager 

A simple Java application that allows a user to check the strength of his or her
password, generate new passwords and save those passwords which can then be viewed at a later time. 

Currently written in a single file/class

#TODO:

-Refactor/clean up code

-Clean up interface 

-Create an "encryptor" class so saved passwords aren't seen in file as plaintext
